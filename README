Have an Amiga, but no compatible mouse? Emulate it using an Arduino or other microcontroller and another computer, for example a Raspberry Pi or your Laptop. This also allows remote control of an Amiga via the mouse.

It works like this:

- Arduino drives Xa/Xb, Ya/Yb and Left/Right mouse button signals. Connect it directly to the DB9 mouse/joystick port.
- Arduino receives control characters from host/remote computer that correspond to left/right/down/up/lmb/rmb mouse movements.
- The included example control application (written in Python) opens a window that will accept your mouse movements and convert them into corresponding mouse movements on the Amiga.
